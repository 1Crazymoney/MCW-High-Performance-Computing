# Big Compute hands-on lab

ThoughtRender provides image and video processing services to many industries -- marketing and advertising, retail, medical, and media and entertainment. You know those furniture magazines you love to look at? Most of the pictures in these magazines are generated by the HPC compute clusters at ThoughtRender. Their unique ability to tie together industry solutions into a reliable service for their customers (e.g., furniture magazine designers! 3D animated movie makers!), together with their in-house knowledge on image and video, is a quality service that sets them apart from competitors.

They currently operate their own, on-premises services (with their own on-premises HPC clusters, and other IT infrastructure), but their success has led to challenges in terms of their growth, and ability to scale to new jobs, and new industries. They are curious about cloud and think that not only could it help them scale, but help them improve costs and pass savings to customers, address the seasonality of rendering demand (by only paying for resources when actually used) and to take advantage of new technologies, such as the latest GPUs.

They believe that bursting jobs to the cloud could help them deliver bigger jobs, or regular jobs quicker for their customers (e.g., in 1 day, instead of 5 days). They intend to pilot a solution to address this.

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement big compute workloads targeted at 3D rendering and media processing in Azure using Azure Batch and Azure Storage.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy Azure Batch and an Azure Batch Pool consisting of Linux Virtual Machines. You will be able to configure the pool of VMs to run the FFmpeg app to process videos across the VM nodes in the pool. You will be able to do this using Batch templates and files, which enable you to perform scale-out execution of command line executables (in this case FFmpeg) without having to write any code.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

In this lab, you deploy Azure Batch and an Azure Batch Pool consisting of Linux Virtual Machines. The Pool of VMs is configured to run the FFmpeg app to process videos across the VM nodes in the pool. This is done using Batch templates and files, which enable you to perform scale-out execution of command line executables (in this case FFmpeg) without having to write any code. You can use Azure Batch Explorer or the Azure CLI to manage and monitor jobs executing in the Pool.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription).
- Local machine running Windows or Mac OS X.

## Before the Hands-on Lab

Before attending the hands-on lab workshop, you should set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab.

You should follow all the steps provided in the [Before the Hands-on Lab](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Big%20Compute.md) section to prepare your environment before attending the hands-on lab. Failure to complete the Before the Hands-on Lab setup may result in an inability to complete the lab with in the time allowed.

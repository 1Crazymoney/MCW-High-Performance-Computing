# Big Compute



## Target audience
TBD

## Abstract

### Workshop

Setup and configure a scale-out media processing architecture using Azure Batch. You will use big compute (scale out compute, embarrassingly parallel processing) techniques without having to write a lot of code, learning how these tasks can be accomplished declaratively.

Learning Objectives:

-   Learn the core capabilities of Azure Batch

-   Understand how to author custom Pool and Job templates

-   Work with Job input and output files

-   Learn to author Batch auto-scale formulas

-   Leverage Batch Labs and the Azure Portal for management and monitoring

-   Use Marketplace applications to simplify common big compute tasks, such as 3D rendering
